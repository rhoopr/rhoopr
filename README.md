# Hey, I'm Rob 👋

**Sr. Technical Program Manager [@scala-computing](https://github.com/scala-computing)**

I ship complex software.  Network simulation, distributed systems, AI infra at data center scale.

Before I ran programs, I wrote them (C++, C#, MATLAB, APIs on Azure/SAP). I still like to stay close to the code.
