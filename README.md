# Hey, I'm Rob 👋

**Sr. Technical Program Manager @ Scala Computing**

I drive complex software programs from zero to shipped — network simulation, distributed systems, AI infrastructure at data center scale. Before I ran programs, I wrote code (C++, C#, MATLAB, APIs on Azure/SAP).

Off the clock, I build things in Rust.
