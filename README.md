# Hey, I'm Rob 👋

**Sr. Technical Program Manager @ Scala Computing**

I ship complex software programs: network simulation, distributed systems, AI workloads at data center scale. 
Before I managed programs, I wrote code (C++, C#, MATLAB, APIs on Azure/SAP).

When I'm not aligning roadmaps, I build side projects.
